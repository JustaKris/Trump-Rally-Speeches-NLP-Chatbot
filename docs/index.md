# Trump Speeches NLP Chatbot API — Technical Documentation

Production-ready AI/ML platform demonstrating enterprise-grade practices in natural language processing, retrieval-augmented generation, and modern backend development.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project demonstrates expertise in:

- **Advanced RAG Architecture** — Modular design with dedicated components for search, confidence scoring, entity analytics, and document loading
- **Hybrid Retrieval Systems** — Semantic search (MPNet 768d) combined with BM25 keyword matching and cross-encoder reranking
- **Production API Development** — FastAPI with 12+ RESTful endpoints, modular route organization, type-safe Pydantic models
- **Entity Analytics** — Automated entity extraction with sentiment analysis and contextual associations
- **Professional DevOps** — Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, automated testing (65%+ coverage), code quality enforcement
- **LLM Integration** — Google Gemini for context-aware answer generation with fallback extraction

## Core Features

### RAG Q&A System

Ask natural language questions about 35 political speeches (300,000+ words):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/rag/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What economic policies were discussed?", "top_k": 5}'
```

**Features:**
- Modular RAG components: SearchEngine, ConfidenceCalculator, EntityAnalyzer, DocumentLoader
- Semantic search using MPNet embeddings (768-dimensional)
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and BM25 keyword matching
- Cross-encoder reranking for improved precision
- Multi-factor confidence scoring (retrieval quality, consistency, coverage, entity mentions)
- Entity extraction and analytics with sentiment analysis
- Google Gemini LLM for answer generation

### NLP Endpoints

Traditional and AI-powered NLP analysis:
- **Sentiment Analysis** — FinBERT transformer model
- **Topic Analysis** — AI-powered semantic clustering with contextual snippets and LLM-generated insights
- **Word Frequency** — Statistical text analysis
- **N-gram Analysis** — Bigram and trigram extraction

### Interactive Web Interface

Single-page application at the root (`/`) for testing all features without writing code.
