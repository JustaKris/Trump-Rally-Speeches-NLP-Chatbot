"""Pytest configuration and fixtures.

Provides test configuration, fixtures, and warning filters for handling
third-party deprecation warnings that we cannot control.

ChromaDB has a known issue where it accesses model_fields on Pydantic model instances,
which is deprecated in Pydantic v2.11+. Since we cannot control ChromaDB's code,
we suppress this specific warning at the pytest level.
